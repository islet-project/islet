## Islet RMM Interfaces 
Islet RMM adheres to the Arm Realm Management Monitor (RMM) specification, which defines interfaces between the Host and RMM, as well as between the Realm and RMM. The RMM specification is publicly available at [Arm's official documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0137/latest/). Islet currently supports version 1.0-REL0 of this specification.
